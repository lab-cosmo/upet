# UPET: Universal Models for Advanced Atomistic Simulations

**UPET** is a family of universal interatomic potentials for advanced materials
modeling across the periodic table. These models are based on the **Point Edge
Transformer (PET)** architecture trained on various popular atomistic datasets,
and they are capable of predicting energies and forces in complex atomistic
workflows. The package also ships **PET-MAD-DOS**, a universal model for
predicting the electronic density of states (DOS) of materials and molecules,
as well as their Fermi levels and bandgaps.

📖 **Full documentation:** <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/upet/latest/>

## Installation

Install UPET from PyPI:

```bash
pip install upet
```

Or directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install upet@git+https://github.com/lab-cosmo/upet.git
```

See the [installation guide](https://lab-cosmo.github.io/upet/latest/installation.html)
for additional methods (specific versions, `uv`, etc.).

## Quick start

Run a single-point evaluation with the ASE-compatible `UPETCalculator`:

```python
from upet.ase import UPETCalculator
from ase.build import bulk

atoms = bulk("Si", cubic=True, a=5.43, crystalstructure="diamond")
calculator = UPETCalculator(model="pet-mad-s", version="1.5.0", device="cpu")
atoms.calc = calculator

energy = atoms.get_potential_energy()
forces = atoms.get_forces()
```

For DOS calculations, you can use the `PETMADDOSCalculator`:

```python
  from upet.ase.dos import PETMADDOSCalculator
  from ase.build import bulk

  atoms = bulk("Si", cubic=True, a=5.43, crystalstructure="diamond")
  calculator = PETMADDOSCalculator(version="latest", device="cpu")
  results = pet_mad_dos_calculator.calculate(atoms)
```
where ``results`` is a dictionary and the keys include ``dos_raw``, ``dos_denoised``, 
``fermi_level``and ``bandgap``. Each key corresponds to its output quantitiy, eg. 
``dos_denoised`` is the denoised DOS obtained by applying a denoising algorithm on the 
raw predicted DOS. The DOS has units of states/eV and is projected on an energy grid 
with intervals of 0.05 eV. The bandgap and Fermi level has units of eV.


The first call downloads the checkpoint from the
[HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/lab-cosmo/upet) and caches it
locally, so subsequent calls are fast. If `version` is omitted, the latest
available version is used.

To list available models, sizes, and versions:

```python
from upet import list_upet

list_upet(model="pet-mad", size="s")
list_upet(model="pet-mad")
list_upet()
```

## Pre-trained models

UPET ships several pre-trained model families (PET-MAD, PET-OAM, PET-OMat,
PET-OMATPES, PET-SPICE) at multiple sizes. The full table with supported
elements, training sets, and recommended use cases is in the
[models documentation](https://lab-cosmo.github.io/upet/latest/models.html).
All checkpoints are available on the
[HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/lab-cosmo/upet).
