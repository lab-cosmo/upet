# High-throughput, batched evaluation of UPET in ASE

While the traditional methods of the provided ASE calculator are appropriate to
run simulations, they are not optimal when the goal is to evaluate the model on
a large number of pre-determined structures. For that case, we provide a much
more efficient batched evaluator in the `compute_energy` method.

## Example

```python
import torch
from upet.ase import UPETCalculator
from ase.build import bulk


device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
calculator = UPETCalculator(model="pet-mad-s", version="1.0.2", device=device)

atoms = bulk("Si", cubic=True, a=5.43, crystalstructure="diamond")
dataset = [atoms] * 100

# Split in batches of 10. Generally, the larger the batch size, the better.
batch_size = 10
batches = []
for i in range(0, len(dataset), batch_size):
    batch = dataset[i : i + batch_size]
    batches.append(batch)

all_energies = []
all_forces = []
for batch in batches:
    # Calculate the energies and forces for the batch
    results = calculator.compute_energy(batch, compute_forces_and_stresses=True)
    all_energies.extend(results["energy"])
    all_forces.extend(results["forces"])
```
